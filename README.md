# Time Tracker

## Things I learnt from this project
- Better layout
- Simple class abstractions, don't make them complex

## Things to remember
- @required parameter checks if the parameter is passed or not, it DOES NOT checks if the value of that parameter is null or not. For that, you need to use 'assert <_variable> != null'
- User assertions to catch errors early

## New Widgets
- Opacity
